 Smart Home Gesture Control App for CSE 535: Mobile Computing

Part 1 of the project involves creating 3 screens:
1. A drop-down menu with 17 gestures.
2. The video performing the selected geature and a "practice" button that takes the user to screen 3.
3. A camera interface that allows the user to record the gesture and the video is no longer than 5 seconds, and an "upload' button that saves the video to a flask server.

Part 2 of the project includes test videos, train data, main.py python file, and the output on result.csv file.
